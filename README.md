# Fruit-Shelf-Life-Classification-From-Images
The project employs computer vision and machine learning, utilizing object detection techniques, to classify and predict fruit shelf life from images. The goal is to develop a system that analyzes fruit images, determining their freshness and remaining shelf life. 

# Fruit Shelf Life Prediction


## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for the "Fruit Shelf Life Prediction" project, conducted by [Riya Sanjay Dhawas]([link-to-riya-profil](https://github.com/reyu0811)) affiliated with the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence department at the International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur, India.

## Abstract

Accurate estimation of fruit shelf life is vital for quality maintenance and reducing food wastage. Leveraging deep learning and object detection, this research aims to predict the remaining shelf life of fruits efficiently.
